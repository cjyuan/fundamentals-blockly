## Array: Adding and Removing items

This example demonstrates how to
- remove an item from an array 
- add an item to an array
- show the content of an array as text


### The blocks 

- **`[get/remove] the [first/last] item from the array {<array variable>}`**
  - This block has three settings:
    1. **`get`**: Get the value of the first/last item of an array.
    1. **`remove`**: Remove the first/last item from an array.
    1. **`get and remove`**: Perform both **`get`** and **`remove`** in one operation. 

      
- **`add {value} at the [start/end] of {<array variable>}`**
  - Add a new item to the front or rear of an array.

### What does this blockly program do?

The program performs the following two operations to array `fruits`:
  - removes its first item 
  - add "Orange" to the end of the array

The program then displays the content of the resulting array as text, providing
a convenient way to visualise the data stored in the array.
To display array items in an HTML list one by one, please refer to the next example.
